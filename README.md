# Klipbook

Klipbook takes the highlights and notes that you've created on your Kindle and
outputs them into nice html or JSON.

## An example of a html clippings file generated by Klipbook

of a clippings file" />

## What sources does it support?

Klipbook can take your highlights from a clippings file off a physical Kindle device
or from the [Kindle highlights site](https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights)
itself.

## When should I use the file and when should I use the site?

If your books are purchased from Amazon directly then use the site. The site is the
canonical source and will contain all of your notes and highlights from across all of
your Kindle devices and applications. Currently the Amazon highlights site only shows
clippings for books you've purchased on Amazon.

If your books are personal documents and you've read them on your Kindle device
itself then you should use the file from that device as a source i.e. your Kindle
device only keeps clippings that you made directly on it.

## How does it work?

Klipbook supports three commands: `list`, `tohtml`, and `tojson`.

### To HTML

`tohtml` retrieves the clippings from your latest annotated books and writes them
out into a pretty html file for each book.

#### From a file

Copy your clippings file (called "My Clippings.txt" on a 3rd generation Kindle) from
your Kindle device to your local drive via USB.

Then write out a list of your clippings via:

```sh
$ klipbook tohtml -i "My Clippings.txt"
```

This command will write the collected clippings for the latest annotated book to a
file in the current directory. You can override the output directory with the
`--outdir` switch.

You can also specify a maximum count of books you'd like collated with the
`--number` switch.

Klipbook will not overwrite an exiting file by default. You can change this with the
`--force` flag.

#### From the site

Specify your Amazon credentials to klipbook and it will scrape the site and
output a clippings file.

```sh
$ klipbook tohtml -c my-username@blah.com:my-password
```

The same flags above apply.

Note that the scraping requires a network connection (obviously) and can take a while
so please be patient.

### Set up defaults

If you don't feel like having your Amazon credentials in your shell history you can
set your default source in the klipbook rc file: `~/.klipbookrc`.

This is simply a YAML file and you can specify default values for the source and the
output directory, e.g.

```sh
$ cat ~/.klipbookrc

:credentials: my-username@blah.com:my-password
:outdir: /path/to/my/default/output/directory
```

Command line options override the defaults stored in the rc file.

### List

The `list` command lists the books available in the specified source.

```sh
$ klipbook list -i "My Clippings.txt"

Book list:
[1] The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler
[2] How to jump out of a plane without a parachute and survive by Rip Rockjaw
```

By default it will only list the latest book. This can be overrided with the
`--number` switch.

### To JSON

`tojson` pulls together the clippings from your latest annotated books and combines
them into a single JSON file.

```sh
$ klipbook tojson -i "My Clippings.txt" -o books.json
```

You can rerun collate on an existing JSON file to add new books. By default existing
books in the JSON file will not be overwritten. This can be changed with the `--force`
flag.
